# Books_Manager
A project I made for my first term  Python programming class. 
For this assignment I was provided a list of +1000 books in a text file. Their details (Author, Title, Publisher, Shelf, Category, Subject) were separated by a tab.
This program is entirely terminal-based and allows the user to search up a book by any of the details above. 
It also shows the user if there are any duplicates, and allows the user to move books to different shelves. 

When the user quits the program, any moves that the user has made will be stored in the text file. 

This program also comes with a suite of unit-tests to ensure functions work as intended.
